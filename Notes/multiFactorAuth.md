# Multi Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to verify their identity using multiple factors before gaining access to a system, application, or account. This enhances security by ensuring that even if one factor (like a password) is compromised, the account remains protected.
## How MFA works
The user enters their username and password.
The system requests an additional authentication factor (e.g., OTP sent to their phone).
The user provides the second factor.
If both factors are correct, access is granted

## Benefits of MFA
Enhances security by reducing reliance on passwords.
Prevents unauthorized access even if credentials are leaked.
Meets compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
Protects against phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force attacks.

## Method
TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password): Generated by apps like Google Authenticator.
OTP via Authenticator Apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)

=> npm install speakeasy qrcode
speakeasy → Generates and verifies TOTP-based OTPs.
qrcode → Generates a QR code for users to scan in Google Authenticator.
